I design and reason about systems.

For years, my work has focused on building cloud and platform architectures by understanding how systems behave from the ground up — from infrastructure and operating systems to distributed services and applications.

My background is strongly rooted in Linux and computer science. I spend most of my time thinking about system boundaries, failure modes, performance characteristics, and long-term maintainability, rather than individual tools or short-term solutions.

I’ve been involved in designing and evolving large-scale platforms, where infrastructure, software, and operations are treated as a single architectural problem. More recently, this perspective has extended into AI infrastructure and large-scale model serving.

I prefer simple, well-reasoned systems, clear trade-offs, and designs that can survive real-world usage.
