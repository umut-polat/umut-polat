### Hi, I'm Umut Polat

Cloud & Platform Engineer with a strong Linux and computer science background.

I work across infrastructure and development, focusing on designing and operating systems as a whole — from the underlying platform to the services running on top of it. I care about how systems behave in real conditions: performance, failure, scalability, and maintainability.

My work usually sits at the intersection of Linux, distributed systems, backend development, and cloud platforms. Recently, I’ve been spending more time on AI infrastructure and large-scale model serving from a systems perspective.

I enjoy learning by building, keeping things simple, and understanding the trade-offs behind the abstractions we use.

- Interested in designing systems that span infrastructure, software, and operations 
- Strong Linux and open-source focus  
- Board Member & Community Lead at **Linux Evi Association**
